	abstract = {The {\textbackslash}textit\{heavy-fluxonium\} circuit is a promising building block for superconducting quantum processors due to its long relaxation and dephasing time at the half-flux frustration point. However, the suppressed charge matrix elements and low transition frequency have made it challenging to perform fast single-qubit gates using standard protocols. We report on new protocols for reset, fast coherent control, and readout, that allow high-quality operation of the qubit with a 14 MHz transition frequency, an order of magnitude lower in energy than the ambient thermal energy scale. We utilize higher levels of the fluxonium to initialize the qubit with \$97\${\textbackslash}\% fidelity, corresponding to cooling it to \$190{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu K\}\$. We realize high-fidelity control using a universal set of single-cycle flux gates, which are comprised of directly synthesizable fast pulses, while plasmon-assisted readout is used for measurements. On a qubit with \$T\_1, T\_\{2e\}{\textbackslash}sim\${\textasciitilde}300{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu s\}\$, we realize single-qubit gates in \$20-60\${\textasciitilde}ns with an average gate fidelity of \$99.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ as characterized by randomized benchmarking.},

	abstract = {In circuit QED, protocols for quantum gates and readout of superconducting qubits often rely on the dispersive regime, reached when the qubit-photon detuning ?? is large compared to the mutual coupling strength. For qubits including the Cooper-pair box and transmon, selection rules dramatically restrict the contributions to dispersive level shifts ??. By contrast, in the absence of selection rules many virtual transitions contribute to ?? and can produce sizable dispersive shifts even at large detuning. We present theory for a generic multilevel qudit capacitively coupled to one or multiple harmonic modes and give general expressions for the effective Hamiltonian in second- and fourth-order perturbation theory. Applying our results to the fluxonium system, we show that the absence of strong selection rules explains the surprisingly large dispersive shifts observed in experiments and leads to the prediction of a two-photon vacuum Rabi splitting. Quantitative predictions from our theory are in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of magnetic flux and reveal that fourth-order resonances are important for the phase modulation observed in fluxonium spectroscopy.},

Relative to architectures that exclusively rely on a direct coupling between fluxonium qubits, FTF enables stronger couplings for gates using noncomputational states while simultaneously suppressing the static controlled-phase entangling rate (?????) down to kilohertz levels, all without requiring strict parameter matching. Here, we implement FTF with a flux-tunable transmon coupler and demonstrate a microwave-activated controlled-?? (CZ) gate whose operation frequency can be tuned over a 2-GHz range, adding frequency allocation freedom for FTFs in larger systems. Across this range, state-of-the-art CZ gate fidelities are observed over many bias points and reproduced across the two devices characterized in this work. After optimizing both the operation frequency and the gate duration, we achieve peak CZ fidelities in the 99.85\%{\textendash}99.9\% range. Finally, we implement model-free reinforcement learning of the pulse parameters to boost the mean gate fidelity up to 99.922\%{\textpm}0.009\%, averaged over roughly an hour between scheduled training runs. Beyond the microwave-activated CZ gate we present here, FTF can be applied to a variety of other fluxonium gate schemes to improve gate fidelities and passively reduce unwanted ????? interactions.},

We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with approximately 50-MHz frequencies and approximately 5-GHz anharmonicities. The coupler enables the qubits to have a large tuning range of ????? coupling strengths (-35 to 75 MHz). The ????? coupling strength is {\textless}3 kHz across the entire coupler bias range and {\textless}100 Hz at the coupler off position. These qualities lead to fast high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates.

	abstract = {Interfacing long-lived qubits with propagating photons is a fundamental challenge in quantum technology. Cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures rely on an off-resonant cavity, which blocks the qubit emission and enables a quantum non-demolition (QND) dispersive readout. However, no such buffer mode is necessary for controlling a large class of three-level systems that combine a metastable qubit transition with a bright cycling transition, using the electron shelving effect. Here we demonstrate shelving of a circuit atom, fluxonium, placed inside a microwave waveguide. With no cavity modes in the setup, the qubit coherence time exceeds 50 $\mu$s, and the cycling transition{\textquoteright}s radiative lifetime is under 100 ns. By detecting a homodyne fluorescence signal from the cycling transition, we implement a QND readout of the qubit and account for readout errors using a minimal optical pumping model. Our result establishes a resource-efficient (cavityless) alternative to cQED for controlling superconducting qubits.},

	abstract = {There are two elementary superconducting qubit types that derive directly from the quantum harmonic oscillator. In one, the inductor is replaced by a nonlinear Josephson junction to realize the widely used charge qubits with a compact phase variable and a discrete charge wave function. In the other, the junction is added in parallel, which gives rise to an extended phase variable, continuous wave functions, and a rich energy-level structure due to the loop topology. While the corresponding rf superconducting quantum interference device Hamiltonian was introduced as a quadratic quasi-one-dimensional potential approximation to describe the fluxonium qubit implemented with long Josephson-junction arrays, in this work we implement it directly using a linear superinductor formed by a single uninterrupted aluminum wire. We present a large variety of qubits, all stemming from the same circuit but with drastically different characteristic energy scales. This includes flux and fluxonium qubits but also the recently introduced quasicharge qubit with strongly enhanced zero-point phase fluctuations and a heavily suppressed flux dispersion. The use of a geometric inductor results in high reproducibility of the inductive energy as guaranteed by top-down lithography{\textemdash}a key ingredient for intrinsically protected superconducting qubits.},

Such an element is crucial for preserving the quantum coherence in circuits exploiting large fluctuations of the superconducting phase. Our results show internal losses less than 20 ppm, self-resonant frequencies greater than 10 GHz, and phase-slip rates less than 1 mHz, enabling direct application of such arrays for quantum information and metrology.

	abstract = {Time-dependent drives play a crucial role in quantum computing efforts with circuit quantum electrodynamics. They enable single-qubit control and entangling logical operations, as well as qubit readout. However, their presence can lead to deleterious effects such as large ac-Stark shifts and unwanted qubit transitions ultimately reflected into reduced control or readout fidelities. Qubit cloaking was introduced by Lled{\'o} et al. [C. Lled{\'o}, R. Dassonneville, A. Moulinas et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 6313 (2023)] to temporarily decouple the qubit from the coherent photon population of a driven cavity, allowing for the application of arbitrary displacements to the cavity field while avoiding the deleterious effects on the qubit. For qubit readout, cloaking permits us to prearm the cavity with an, in principle, arbitrarily large number of photons, in anticipation of the qubit-state-dependent evolution of the cavity field, allowing for improved readout strategies. Here, we take a closer look at two such strategies: first, arm-and-release readout, introduced together with qubit cloaking, where after arming the cavity, the cloaking mechanism is released and the cavity field evolves under the application of a constant drive amplitude; and, second, an arm-and-longitudinal readout scheme, where the cavity drive amplitude is slowly modulated after the release. We show that the two schemes complement each other, offering an improvement over standard dispersive readout for any values of the dispersive interaction and the cavity decay rate, as well as any target measurement integration time. Our results provide a recommendation for improving qubit readout without changes to the standard circuit-QED architecture.},

Single-mode squeezing can be exploited to exponentially increase the signal-to-noise ratio of this readout protocol.
