abstract = {One approach for building quantum computers is based on superconductors with appropriately designed components to control the pairs of charges flowing through the circuits. However, at the single-electron level, required quantum noise—generated by quantum fluctuations and throwing offset charges into the device—presents a real problem in manipulating the delicate quantum states of the qubits. Manucharyan et al. (p. 113) present a clever piece of quantum circuit engineering that can suppress the effect of the quantum noise and allow the quantum circuit to operate without disturbance. Circuit engineering was used to mitigate the effects of quantum noise in superconducting quantum circuits. The promise of single Cooper-pair quantum circuits based on tunnel junctions for metrology and quantum information applications is severely limited by the influence of offset charges: random, slowly drifting microscopic charges inherent in many solid-state systems. By shunting a small junction with the Josephson kinetic inductance of a series array of large-capacitance tunnel junctions, thereby ensuring that all superconducting islands are connected to the circuit by at least one large junction, we have realized a new superconducting artificial atom that is totally insensitive to offset charges. Yet its energy levels manifest the anharmonic structure associated with single Cooper-pair effects, a useful component for solid-state quantum computation.}}

	abstract = {The fluxonium qubit is a promising candidate for quantum computation due to its long coherence times and large anharmonicity. We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with approximately 50-MHz frequencies and approximately 5-GHz anharmonicities. The coupler enables the qubits to have a large tuning range of ????? coupling strengths (-35 to 75 MHz). The ????? coupling strength is {\textless}3 kHz across the entire coupler bias range and {\textless}100 Hz at the coupler off position. These qualities lead to fast high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. By driving at the difference frequency of the two qubits, we realize a ????SWAP gate in 258 ns with fidelity 99.72\%, and by driving at the sum frequency of the two qubits, we achieve a ????SWAP gate in 102 ns with fidelity 99.91\%. This latter gate is only five qubit Larmor periods in length. We run cross-entropy benchmarking for over 20 consecutive hours and measure stable gate fidelities, with ????SWAP drift (2???) {\textless}0.02\% and ????SWAP drift {\textless}0.08\%.},

	abstract = {Interfacing long-lived qubits with propagating photons is a fundamental challenge in quantum technology. Cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures rely on an off-resonant cavity, which blocks the qubit emission and enables a quantum non-demolition (QND) dispersive readout. However, no such buffer mode is necessary for controlling a large class of three-level systems that combine a metastable qubit transition with a bright cycling transition, using the electron shelving effect. Here we demonstrate shelving of a circuit atom, fluxonium, placed inside a microwave waveguide. With no cavity modes in the setup, the qubit coherence time exceeds 50 $\mu$s, and the cycling transition{\textquoteright}s radiative lifetime is under 100 ns. By detecting a homodyne fluorescence signal from the cycling transition, we implement a QND readout of the qubit and account for readout errors using a minimal optical pumping model. Our result establishes a resource-efficient (cavityless) alternative to cQED for controlling superconducting qubits.},

	abstract = {There are two elementary superconducting qubit types that derive directly from the quantum harmonic oscillator. In one, the inductor is replaced by a nonlinear Josephson junction to realize the widely used charge qubits with a compact phase variable and a discrete charge wave function. In the other, the junction is added in parallel, which gives rise to an extended phase variable, continuous wave functions, and a rich energy-level structure due to the loop topology. While the corresponding rf superconducting quantum interference device Hamiltonian was introduced as a quadratic quasi-one-dimensional potential approximation to describe the fluxonium qubit implemented with long Josephson-junction arrays, in this work we implement it directly using a linear superinductor formed by a single uninterrupted aluminum wire. We present a large variety of qubits, all stemming from the same circuit but with drastically different characteristic energy scales. This includes flux and fluxonium qubits but also the recently introduced quasicharge qubit with strongly enhanced zero-point phase fluctuations and a heavily suppressed flux dispersion. The use of a geometric inductor results in high reproducibility of the inductive energy as guaranteed by top-down lithography{\textemdash}a key ingredient for intrinsically protected superconducting qubits.},

Such an element is crucial for preserving the quantum coherence in circuits exploiting large fluctuations of the superconducting phase. Our results show internal losses less than 20 ppm, self-resonant frequencies greater than 10 GHz, and phase-slip rates less than 1 mHz, enabling direct application of such arrays for quantum information and metrology.

	abstract = {Time-dependent drives play a crucial role in quantum computing efforts with circuit quantum electrodynamics. They enable single-qubit control and entangling logical operations, as well as qubit readout. However, their presence can lead to deleterious effects such as large ac-Stark shifts and unwanted qubit transitions ultimately reflected into reduced control or readout fidelities. Qubit cloaking was introduced by Lled{\'o} et al. [C. Lled{\'o}, R. Dassonneville, A. Moulinas et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 6313 (2023)] to temporarily decouple the qubit from the coherent photon population of a driven cavity, allowing for the application of arbitrary displacements to the cavity field while avoiding the deleterious effects on the qubit. For qubit readout, cloaking permits us to prearm the cavity with an, in principle, arbitrarily large number of photons, in anticipation of the qubit-state-dependent evolution of the cavity field, allowing for improved readout strategies. Here, we take a closer look at two such strategies: first, arm-and-release readout, introduced together with qubit cloaking, where after arming the cavity, the cloaking mechanism is released and the cavity field evolves under the application of a constant drive amplitude; and, second, an arm-and-longitudinal readout scheme, where the cavity drive amplitude is slowly modulated after the release. We show that the two schemes complement each other, offering an improvement over standard dispersive readout for any values of the dispersive interaction and the cavity decay rate, as well as any target measurement integration time. Our results provide a recommendation for improving qubit readout without changes to the standard circuit-QED architecture.},
