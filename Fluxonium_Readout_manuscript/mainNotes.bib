@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="Further lower $\omega _\protect \textrm  {d}$ for readout is not favorable due to thermal heating of the readout resonator leading to photon-shot-noise induced dephasing of the qubit, and hence not analyzed in this work."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="If $\omega _\protect \textrm  {d}\gg \omega _{\mu =N-1}$, a dominating transition mechanism for PMIST would correspond to an excitation of a strongly coupled, low-frequency parasitic mode (i.e., $\mu =\{2,4,6\}$) to a large photon number $y$, leaving just enough energy to produce excitation to some state $f$ in the fluxonium subspace of significant charge matrix elements (see Fig.~\ref {charge-matrix}). However, such large excitations in the parasitic modes would occur with lower probability because of the high photon number $y$ involved in the transition."}
