@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="We can estimate resonance conditions by identifying energy-conserving processes, where $x$ drive photons are converted into a transition with an energy difference $\protect \tilde  {\Delta }_{if,y}$ in the hybridized eigenspace of the fluxonium and parasitic mode $\mu =2$. Here, $\protect \tilde  {\Delta }_{if,y}$ is the transition energy between levels $\mathinner {|{\protect \tilde  {i},\protect \tilde  {m}}\rangle }$ and $\mathinner {|{\protect \tilde  {f},\protect \tilde  {n}}\rangle }$ such that $|m-n|=y$. This equation can also be interpreted as a process where $x$ readout photons convert into $y$ parasitic mode photons and a fluxonium excitation $\mathinner {|{i}\rangle }_\phi \leftrightarrow \mathinner {|{f}\rangle }_\phi $ such that $\Delta _{if}=\hbar |\omega _f-\omega _i|$.

An example is captured by transition $13$ of Table~\ref {tab:PMIST}. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note8,key="Note8",note="For example, transition $2$ corresponds to the emission of four readout photons, which are converted into two parasitic mode photons, absorbed by the mode $\mu =2$, as well as an excitation from $\mathinner {|{0}\rangle }_\phi $ to $\mathinner {|{4}\rangle }_\phi $ in the fluxonium subspace."}
